Since the last blog there were several releases that enhance functionality and mostly performance
especially visible with multiple package arguments. Just try "dnf --assumeno reinstall $(rpm -qa)"
with libdnf-0.9.0 and libdnf-0.11.1 and differences is easily visible. But the real huge improvement
can be seen when results are compared to YUM.
